# project-megabunus
Megabunus is a genus of harvestmen(belongs to the Opliliones spider family). They reproduce asexually.

This project's goal is to build an easy-to-use web service for visual novel games (like Self-Reliance). The service allows visualized codeless level editing, live level loading from the game, live translation, and etc.

This service will include three parts: frontend portal, backend server, and the game client. We hope to create a complete production cycle for visual novel that enable us to quickly deploy and manage contents in the game.
